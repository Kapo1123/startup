I found it very interested using Github to write code.

   The first Simon went well. I was able to use different html code and recreate a Simon. However, I was having issues when I tried to sync my push with Github. It fraustrated me but I am glad it finally worked out.

I decided to change my start up application to a webiste for meme, where people can share their favourite memes and others can common it.

This CSS and HTML start up is hard for me. I spent couple hours to final have something coded. I can tell that I have learned a lot during this assignment. But I also see that there are concepts that I don't understand well. I took another hour to try and figure how to create a vertical list and a horizontal list.

DOM accessing all element:
	function displayElement(el) {
  console.log(el.tagName);
  for (const child of el.children) {
    displayElement(child);
  }
}

displayElement(document);


DOM - insert, modify, or delete

Create a new element:
	create the element on the DOM document
	const newChild = document.createElement('div');
  newChild.textContent = text;
insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree.
const parentElement = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  parentElement.appendChild(newChild);
Removing - removeChild
function deleteChild(parentSelector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
}

deleteChild('#courses divâ€™);
Injecting HTML
Find the first element in te DOM and replace it
const el = document.querySelector('div');
el.innerHTML = '<div class="injected"><b>Hello</b>!</div>'
Event Listeners

const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
Clipboard	Cut, copied, pasted
Focus	An element gets focus
Keyboard	Keys are pressed
Mouse	Click events
Text selection	When text is selected




This time I created javascript files for my startup. I learned simple function and high-order functions on Javascript. I tried to make the table and the delete buttons on each row. The problems was on the for loop and I finally firgured to put it on my click_press function to have addeventlistener to all my delete_button. All of all, I am satisified on applying waht I have learned.
